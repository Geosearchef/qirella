//TODO start unit testing, complex, vectors, matricies

Statevector simulation
- passing
- matricies
- register states during simulation (when wanted, always input)

Measurement
- Measurement framework
- measurement operator building from basis states
--> use measurement framework to define measuring, allow building measurement operator from (orthonormal) basis states

Function / element circuits / subcircuits
  how to use additional qubits? Make larger elements? just add additional qubits not seen by the user? What if the subcircuit inputs on multiple qubits --> need larger elements
- need larger circuit elements for subcircuits using multiple qubits
- implementation can come later

Sampling / circuit/output simulation


Manual gate specification
