- control, delete, properties menu
 // TODO: different controls size?

- how to render states
- how to present results

Statevector simulation
- passing
- matricies
- show register states during simulation (when wanted, always input)

Function / element circuits / subcircuits
  how to use additional qubits? Make larger elements? just add additional qubits not seen by the user? What if the subcircuit inputs on multiple qubits --> need larger elements
- need larger circuit elements for subcircuits using multiple qubits
- implementation can come later

Sampling / circuit/output simulation

TODO: UI is not resizable

Manual gate specification
