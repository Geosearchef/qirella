Function / element circuits / subcircuits
  how to use additional qubits? Make larger elements? just add additional qubits not seen by the user? What if the subcircuit inputs on multiple qubits --> need larger elements
- need larger circuit elements for subcircuits using multiple qubits
- implementation can come later

Sampling / circuit/output simulation
