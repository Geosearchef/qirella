- custom rotation gate
- histogram

- gate color
- load / store for algs experimentation

- classical



- zero gate
  - this is not unitary
  - this produces a a^2 + b^2 + 2ab output
  - this forces a measurement relative to the target state regardless of probability
    - if p = 0: resulting state vec is 0!
  - a.k.a you do not do this
